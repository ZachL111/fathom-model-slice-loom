# fathom-model-slice-loom

`fathom-model-slice-loom` is a Haskell project for ML utilities. It turns create a Haskell reference implementation for slice workflows, centered on event replay, fixture event logs, and golden state snapshots into a small local model with readable fixtures and a direct verification command.

## Reading Fathom Model Slice Loom

Start with the README, then open `metadata/project.json` to check the constants behind the examples. After that, `fixtures/cases.csv` shows the compact path and `examples/extended_cases.csv` gives a wider look at the same rule.

## Purpose

The repository exists to keep a technical idea small enough to reason about. The implementation avoids external dependencies where possible, then uses fixtures to make changes easy to review.

## What It Does

- Models feature signals with deterministic scoring and explicit review decisions.
- Uses fixture data to keep metric checks changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for windowed behavior, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents explainable outputs tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.

## Design Sketch

The design is intentionally direct: parse or construct a signal, score it, classify it, and verify the expected branch. This makes the repository useful for studying ml utilities behavior without needing a service or database unless the language project itself is SQL. The Haskell code keeps the pure scoring function isolated so tests can check it without setup.

## Files Worth Reading

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Setup

The only required setup is the local Haskell toolchain. After cloning, stay in the repo root so fixture paths resolve correctly.

## Usage

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Verification

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Fixture Notes

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `recovery` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## Limits

The examples cover useful edges, not every edge. A larger version would add malformed-input tests, richer reports, and deeper domain parsers.

## Next Directions

- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add one more ml utilities fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
